system requirements:
1. Framebuffer access. Press ctrl-alt-Fx to switch to a virtual terminal and log
   in. Make sure you are in the video group so that you can access the
   framebuffer. You can add yourself to the group with
   $ sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
   After adding yourself to the video group, you will need to log out and back
   in for the changes to take effect. You can test if you have framebuffer
   access by doing:
   cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb0
2. Framebuffer resolution of 1024x768x32. You can set this using the fbset
   command.
3. Working ALSA audio with 8 channel support. This demo uses the aplay command
   for audio playback. You can test if it is working by running:
   $ aplay -c8 /dev/urandom
   Note: depending on your configuration, aplay may not work if you are logged
   in as root.

after the above are satisfied, do:
$ ./xorchitecture

ALTERNATIVE TO FRAMEBUFFER:
If your framebuffer isn't working or cannot be set to the required resolution,
there is a simple C program included that uses SDL2 to emulate a framebuffer
device. You will still need aplay working to use this emulated version. To run
the framebuffer emulator version, do:
$ fbe/xorchitecture-fbe.sh

to build:
$ nasm -f bin xorchitecture.asm -o xorchitecture
$ chmod +x xorchitecture
